Crunchy Data announces the release of [Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-for-kubernetes/) 5.0.3.

Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes is powered by [PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator), the open source [Postgres Operator](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) from [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com). [PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/container-suite).

Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes 5.0.4 includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) versions 14.1, 13.5, 12.9, 11.14, and 10.19 are now available.
- The [pgnodemx](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgnodemx) extension is now at version 1.0.6.

## Features

- The JDBC connection string for the Postgres database and a PgBouncer instance is now available in the User Secret using `jdbc-uri` and `pgbouncer-jdbc-uri` respectively.

## Changes

- Editing the `password` field of a User Secret now [changes a password]({{< relref "architecture/user-management.md" >}}#custom-passwords), instead of having to create a verifier.
- [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) is now automatically enabled when using the `crunchy-postgres-gis` container.
- The [Downward API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/) is mounted to the `database` containers.
- [pgnodemx](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgnodemx) can now be enabled and used without having to enable monitoring.

## Fixes

- Fix issue when performing a restore with PostgreSQL 14. Specifically, if there are mismatched PostgreSQL configuration parameters, PGO will resume replay and let PostgreSQL crash so PGO can ultimately fix it, vs. the restore pausing indefinitely.
- The pgBackRest Pod no longer automatically mounts the default Service Account. Reported by (@Shrivastava-Varsha).
- The Jobs that move data between volumes now have the correct Security Context set.
- The UBI 8 `crunchy-upgrade` container contains all recent PostgreSQL versions that can be upgraded.
- Ensure controller references are used for all objects that need them, instead of owner references.
